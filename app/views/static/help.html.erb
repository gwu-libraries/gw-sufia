<h2 id="faq">Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
<p>How large a file can I upload to GW ScholarSpace, using Box and Dropbox?</p>
<ul>
  <li>As of November 2014, maximum size for uploads via Box and Dropbox is 1.9GB. The maximum size will increase significantly once we upgrade our asset management infrastructure in summer 2015, which the GW ScholarSpace team will be testing thoroughly to identify the maximum size.</li>
</ul>
<p>Who can deposit content into GW ScholarSpace?</p>
<ul><li>The George Washington University faculty, students and staff may deposit content into GW ScholarSpace, free of charge.  All that is required is a GW NetID and password. Users who are external to GW may view and download open access (publicly available) content. </li></ul>
<p>What’s the difference between GW ScholarSpace and Box.com or Dropbox.com?</p>
<ul>
  <li>GW ScholarSpace differs from these cloud storage providers in three important ways:
      <ol>
        <li><b>Reliability:</b> GW ScholarSpace is a GW service that is fully funded and supported by the University. The GW Libraries manages and makes persistently accessible the content that is deposited into GW ScholarSpace.</li>
        <li><b>Preservation:</b> Our main focus is to preserve your scholarly work and make it accessible for the long term.  Files deposited into GW ScholarSpace undergo audits and other digital preservation checks. This helps ensure that your scholarship will be available for generations to come. Dropbox and Box are commercial services – businesses – whose main objectives are to enable file sharing and file storage.</li>
        <li><b>Sharing:</b> GW ScholarSpace gives you the option to share your work with a worldwide audience. Permissions may be set for each file that you upload (public, Penn State only, or private).  If you choose to make your content publicly accessible, researchers from around the world can easily discover and find your work via major search engines, such as Google.</li>
      </ol>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>Can I reference GW ScholarSpace in my data management plan for a federal grant?</p>
<ul>
  <li>Yes!  GW ScholarSpace is an optimal service for making your federally funded research openly accessible to the public and meeting the requirements of federal funding agencies.
