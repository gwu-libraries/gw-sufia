<h2 id="faq">Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
<p>How large a file can I upload to GW Scholar Space, using Box and Dropbox?</p>
<ul>
  <li>As of November 2014, maximum size for uploads via Box and Dropbox is 1.9GB. The maximum size will increase significantly once we upgrade our asset management infrastructure in summer 2015, which the GW Scholar Space team will be testing thoroughly to identify the maximum size.</li>
</ul>
<p>Who can deposit content into GW Scholar Space?</p>
<ul><li>The George Washington University faculty, students and staff may deposit content into GW Scholar Space, free of charge.  All that is required is a GW NetID and password. Users who are external to GW may view and download open access (publicly available) content. </li></ul>
<p>What’s the difference between GW Scholar Space and Box.com or Dropbox.com?</p>
<ul>
  <li>GW Scholar Space differs from these cloud storage providers in three important ways:
      <ol>
        <li><b>Reliability:</b> GW Scholar Space is a GW service that is fully funded and supported by the University. The GW Libraries manages and makes persistently accessible the content that is deposited into GW Scholar Space.</li>
        <li><b>Preservation:</b> Our main focus is to preserve your scholarly work and make it accessible for the long term.  Files deposited into GW Scholar Space undergo audits and other digital preservation checks. This helps ensure that your scholarship will be available for generations to come. Dropbox and Box are commercial services – businesses – whose main objectives are to enable file sharing and file storage.</li>
        <li><b>Sharing:</b> GW Scholar Space gives you the option to share your work with a worldwide audience. Permissions may be set for each file that you upload (public, Penn State only, or private).  If you choose to make your content publicly accessible, researchers from around the world can easily discover and find your work via major search engines, such as Google.</li>
      </ol>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>Can I reference GW Scholar Space in my data management plan for a federal grant?</p>
<ul>
  <li>Yes!  GW Scholar Space is an optimal service for making your federally funded research openly accessible to the public and meeting the requirements of federal funding agencies.
